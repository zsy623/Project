I need you to help me control a first-person interactive fiction game that weaves in storylines from a provided psychological self-report scale. The story's development will be closely, indirectly, and implicitly linked to the scale's item. The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their likely responses to the scale's question. For each time, I will give you your current memory (a brief summary of previous stories. You should use it to store the key content of what has happened so that you can keep track of very long context), the previously written paragraph, and instructions on what to write in the next paragraph.\\nI need you to write:\\n1. Question and its Options: the scale question corresponding to the output paragraph and its options, copied from the self-report scale provided above.\\n2. Output Paragraph: the next paragraph of the interactive fiction game. It should (1) follow the input instructions; (2) be naturally and logically coherent with the previous storyline; and (3) instantiate the scale question above. Each output paragraph should contain only two sentences!\\n3. Output Memory: The updated memory. You should first explain which sentences in the input memory are no longer necessary and why, and then explain what needs to be added into the memory and why. After that you should write the updated memory. The updated memory should be similar to the input memory except the parts you previously thought that should be deleted or added. The updated memory should only store key information. The updated memory should never exceed 20 sentences!\\n4. Output Instruction: short instructions of what to write next (after what you have written). You should output 2 different instructions, each is a possible interesting continuation of the story and represents a potential narrative direction tied to one of the options for the scale question corresponding to the output paragraph. The reader's choice of which instruction to follow should indicate their inclination towards that particular option on the psychological scale. Each output instruction should contain only one sentence!\\nHere are the inputs:\\nStory Title:\\n{title}\\nStory Outline:\\n{outline}\\nCurrent Progress:\\nIt remains {progress:.0f}%\\nInput Memory:\\n{short_memory}\\nInput Paragraph:\\n{input_paragraph}\\nInput Instruction:\\n{input_instruction}\\nNow start writing, organize your output by strictly following the output format as below:\\nQuestion and its Options:\\n<scale question corresponding to the Output Paragraph and its options, in the same json format as that of the item in Self-Report Scale.>\\nOutput Paragraph:\\n<string of output paragraph associated with one and only one scale question>\\nOutput Memory:\\nRational: <string that explain how to update the memory>;\\nUpdated Memory: <string of updated memory>\\nOutput Instruction:\\nInstruction 1: <content for short instruction 1 associated with option 1>\\nInstruction 2: <content for short instruction 2 associated with option 2>\\n\\nVery important!!

The updated memory should never contain over 500 words!\\nFinally, remember that you are develop a first-person interactive fiction game **instantiating the provided psychological self-report scale**.

So don't make up the thinking pattern of the main character.\\nThe order of the output instructions should be the same as the order of the options in the scale question!
